                    some half-lukewarm ones down there, see?)

                    <p>I can't believe how quickly he got the job done! Even
                    though I'm not necesssarily sure that's a good thing...
                    Guess I'll know when I see the pictures.</p>

                    <p>Where to start... Jeremy was incredibly professional
                    and attentive to our needs. He made us feel important,
                    like we were the only thing on his mind.</p>

                <div class='review'>
                    <p>The quality of the pictures were next level. They
                    always garner attention, and I always direct those who ask
                    back here. There's no place with better bang for your
                    buck</p>

                    <p>Oh he's such a dear, he even mowed my lawn for me after
                    we were done. Such a wonderful boy, whoever raised him
                    raised him right.</p>

                    <p>Got the wrong number. Tried to call a thug to 'snap
                    some bones', and this guy showed up and asked where the
                    skeleton was so he could take a picture. Turns out he
                    throws a mean left hook, so it worked out.</p>

                    <p>I was given a hefty discount to write this review. The
                    work was alright, the lighting could use work, and he had
                    no idea how to work his camera. Got the pictures for
                    half-off, though.</p>

                    <p>I was looking for someone to document my archeological
                    dig, and this ruffian shows up and assaults my colleague.
                    Unnacceptable and unprofessional behavior. The pictures did
                    turn out nice, though, and I never did like my colleague
                    much anyway.</p>
